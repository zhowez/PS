        <p>
          I am a recent graduate from Clemson University from Greenville, SC. I
          have a B.S. in Computer Science. I am curently seeking for my first
          software engineering postion. I am open to working remotely or moving
          to find a good job.{" "}

        <p>
          Before attending Clemson University I worked at Build-A-Bear Workshop,
          eventually becomeing an assistant manager. I was an amazing place to
          work a learn how to lead teams and work with a variety of people and
          opinions. During the spring of 2020 I had the amazing oppurtunity to
          work at Walt Disney World Resort through the Disney College Program!
          While the program was cut short due to COVID-19, I had an amazing time
          meeting people from all around the world and working in a fast paced
          enviroment.
